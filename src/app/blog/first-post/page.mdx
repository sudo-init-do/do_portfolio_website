# Shipping fast with Next.js + MDX

Local MDX keeps personal sites fast, simple, and versioned in Git.
Perfect for a personal blog without a full CMS.

## Why Next.js + MDX?

When building a personal portfolio or blog, you want something that's:

- **Fast** - Both to build and to load
- **Simple** - Easy to write and maintain
- **Flexible** - Can handle code examples and custom components
- **Version controlled** - Everything in Git

MDX gives you the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## Getting Started

Here's how to set up MDX in your Next.js project:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
```

Then configure your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = {
  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

## Benefits

### Performance
MDX files are compiled at build time, making them incredibly fast to serve.

### Developer Experience
Write in Markdown but include React components when you need them.

### SEO
Since everything is static, search engines can easily crawl and index your content.

## Conclusion

Next.js + MDX is a powerful combination for content-driven sites. It gives you the performance of static generation with the flexibility of React components.
