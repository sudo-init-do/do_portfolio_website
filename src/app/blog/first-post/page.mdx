# Shipping fast with Next.js + MDX

Local MDX keeps personal sites fast, simple, and versioned in Git.
It's perfect for a personal blog without bringing a full CMS.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This means you can:

- Write content in plain Markdown
- Embed interactive React components
- Keep everything in your codebase
- Version control your content

## Getting Started

Setting up MDX with Next.js is straightforward. Here's what you need to do:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
```

Then configure your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // Add markdown plugins here
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

## Benefits

Using MDX for your blog gives you several advantages:

1. **Performance**: Static generation means fast loading times
2. **Developer Experience**: Write in your favorite editor with syntax highlighting
3. **Version Control**: Track changes with Git
4. **Flexibility**: Mix content with interactive components

## Conclusion

MDX strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power. It's ideal for developers who want to maintain their blog alongside their code, with full control over the content and presentation.

Happy blogging!
